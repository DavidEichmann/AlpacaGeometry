# AlpacaGeometry

This is a simple 2D geometry library extracted from some video game code I've worked on in my free time. It provides some geometry primitives and a set of geometry
related type classes. A central goal of this library is to explore elegant geometry implementations 
through the use of denotational semantics. It was an initial fear that denotational semantics would not be practical and would lead to more complexity. My experience has been the opposite: the denotational semantics guided the implementation toward simple and correct solutions. Ready to have a look? The
```Alpaca.Geo.Prim.Classes``` module is a good place to start.
