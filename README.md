# AlpacaGeometry

This is a simple 2D geometry library providing some geometry primitives and a set of geometry
related type classes. A central goal of this library is elegance through the use of denotational
semantics. It is a natural fear to expect code to gain complexity when employing denotational semantics.
This is because "simple" hacks are no longer tollerated as they do not match the semantics. The
experience with this library has been the exact oppotite: the denotation guided the implementation
toward extremely simple and correct solutions (to a much higher degree of confidence). Ready to jump in? The
```Alpaca.Geo.Prim.Classes``` module is a good place to start.
